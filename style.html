    <p>What we understand today as HTML5 has had a relatively turbulent history.
       You probably already know that HTML is the predominant markup language used 
       to describe content, or data, on the World Wide Web (another lesser-used markup 
       languageisXML).HTML5isthelatestiterationoftheHTML5languageandincludes new features,
       improvements to existing features, and JavaScript APIs.
    </p>

    <p>API stands for Application Programming Interface. Think of an API in the same
       way you think of a graphical user interface or GUI—except that instead of being 
       an interface for humans, it's an interface for your code. An API provides your
       code with a set of “buttons” (predefined methods) that it can press to elicit 
       the desired behavior from the system, software library, or browser.

    <p>Overall,you shouldn't be intimidated if you've had little experience with JavaScript
       or other APIs. While it would certainly be beneficial to have some experience with
       JavaScript or other languages, it isn't mandatory. Whatever the case, we'll walk 
       you through the scripting parts of our book gradually, ensuring that you're not 
       left scratching your head!
